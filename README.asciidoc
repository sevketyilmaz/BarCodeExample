= About SimpleIntent

This project demonstrates how to use an implicit Intent to launch an
external bar code scanning application and retrieve the decoded data.

For this demo to work correctly, your Android device must have the
ZXing barcode scanning app installed. See http://code.google.com/p/zxing/
for more information on ZXing, and a link to the app on Google Play.
